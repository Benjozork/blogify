# blogify

All-in-one blogging engine powered by Ktor and Angular.

## Architecture

Blogify uses `Ktor` on the backend and `Angular` on the frontend.

It uses `PostgreSQL` as a databse.

## Building and deploying

The default deploy configuration runs the backend and the databse as `docker-compose` services. A functioning, local, test deployment can be achieved by running the `localTestDeploy` gradle task.
